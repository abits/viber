description: Initialize a git repo (if needed), commit the scaffold, and create the GitHub repo via gh.
---

Run `bash scripts/repo-init.sh $ARGUMENTS` in the current project.

The script is safe to re-run: it skips `git init` when a repo already exists, creates the initial commit only if there are no commits yet, and if `origin` already points at a github.com URL it just pushes rather than creating a duplicate. Default visibility is `--private`; the user can override with `--public` or `--visibility internal`.

After the script finishes:

- If it printed a `Created:` URL, quote the URL back to the user.
- Print the exact next-steps block the script suggests (`make sync-issues`).
- If the script exited non-zero, surface the error verbatim; do not retry silently.
