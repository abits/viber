## Release — README and CHANGELOG

Every published GitHub release ships two coordinated updates:

1. **`CHANGELOG.md`** at the repo root carries the full history. Prepend a new `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` entry at the top (newest first, immediately after the file's intro paragraphs). Each entry includes a release-page link (`Release: <https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z>`) and 2–5 bullets. If `CHANGELOG.md` doesn't exist yet, create it with a short intro explaining the convention, then add the first entry.
2. **`README.md`** carries only the latest entry. Replace the single existing `## What's new — vX.Y.Z` section with the new one; the previous one already lives in `CHANGELOG.md`. End the section with `Earlier releases: see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).` so readers know where to look.

Both updates land **before** the tag is pushed. If the tag has already shipped without them, add them in a follow-up `docs: announce vX.Y.Z in README and CHANGELOG` commit immediately after.

- Derive the bullets from `git log vPREV..vX.Y.Z --oneline --no-merges`. Skip bumps, pure refactors, and dependency chores unless they fix something the user noticed.
- Keep each bullet one sentence. Lead with the behaviour (`viber update now verifies checksums`), not the file (`updater/updater.go changed`).
- The README bullets and the CHANGELOG bullets for the same release are the same text — write them once, use in both.
- Never retro-edit a previous release's `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Mistakes get a follow-up release note, not an in-place rewrite.
